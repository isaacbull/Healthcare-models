    "Preparing the data, computing basic statistics and constructing simple models are essential steps for data science practice. In this homework, you will use clinical data as raw input to perform **Heart Failure Prediction**. For this homework, **Python** programming will be required. See the attached skeleton code as a start-point for the programming questions.\n",
